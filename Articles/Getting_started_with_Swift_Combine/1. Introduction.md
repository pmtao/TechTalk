Swift Combine is a powerful framework for reactive programming in Swift, introduced by Apple in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15. With Swift Combine, developers can easily handle asynchronous and event-driven programming tasks by modeling data streams as publishers and subscribers. This allows developers to write more efficient, maintainable code that can handle complex data flows with ease.

In this book, we will explore the fundamentals of Swift Combine, including publishers, subscribers, and operators. We will also cover more advanced techniques such as custom publishers and subscribers, schedulers, and threading. Throughout the book, we will use practical examples to illustrate how Swift Combine can be used in real-world iOS and macOS development.

As you read this book, you will learn why reactive programming is important, how Swift Combine works, and how it can help you write better code. Whether you are a beginner to reactive programming or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this book will provide you with a solid foundation in Swift Combine.

Before we dive into the details of Swift Combine, we will first cover the basics of reactive programming and what sets it apart from traditional programming models. We will also explain what you need to know before diving into the rest of the book, including a basic understanding of Swift programming and familiarity with Xcode and iOS/macOS development.

By the end of this book, you will have a deep understanding of Swift Combine and how it can be used to solve complex programming problems. Whether you're building a small iOS app or a large-scale macOS application, Swift Combine can help you write cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code. Let's get started!
