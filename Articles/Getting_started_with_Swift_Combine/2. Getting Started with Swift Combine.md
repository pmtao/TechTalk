- Importing Combine
- Publishers and subscribers

In this section, we will cover the basics of Swift Combine, including importing Combine, working with publishers and subscribers.

# A. Importing Combine

In any Swift file where you want to use Combine, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

`import Combine`

This will make all of Combine's classes, structs, and functions available in your file.

To be noticed, Combine can only be used in iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+.

# B. Publishers and Subscribers

- Understanding the role of publishers and subscribers in Combine
- Creating a publisher to emit data
- Creating a subscriber to receive data from a publisher
- Connecting publishers and subscribers to create a data flow
1. Understanding Publishers and Subscribers

In Combine, publishers and subscribers play critical roles in facilitating the flow of data between different parts of an application. Publishers are objects that emit a sequence of values over time, while subscribers are objects that receive and handle these values.

The publisher is responsible for defining the sequence of values that it will emit, and for notifying its subscribers when new values are available. Publishers can emit a single value, a stream of values, or an error, and can also complete the sequence of values when there are no more values to emit.

Subscribers, on the other hand, are responsible for receiving and handling the values emitted by a publisher. They can handle each value as it is emitted, or accumulate values over time and handle them as a group. Subscribers can also handle errors and completion notifications emitted by a publisher.

In order for a subscriber to receive values from a publisher, it must first establish a connection to the publisher. This connection is established using the `subscribe` method, which takes a closure that defines the behavior of the subscriber.

2. Creating a Publisher

There are two kinds of publishers, one you can create directly, the other created by operating the first one that we call it operators:

- Direct publishers:
   - Use the `Just` publisher to emit a single value.
   - Use the `Future` publisher to emit a single value at a future time.
   - Use the `PassthroughSubject` publisher to emit values based on user events or other triggers.
   - Use the `CurrentValueSubject` publisher to emit values and hold a buffer of the most recently published value.
   - Use `map`, `filter` or other operators to republish the origin publishers.
   - Create a custom publisher by implementing the `Publisher` protocol.

Let's create some publishers:

- Just

```swift
let publisher = Just(42)
```

This creates a publisher that emits a single value (`42`) and then completes immediately.

- Future

```swift
let publisher = Future<String, Error> { promise in
    // Perform an asynchronous task
    DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
        // When the task completes, fulfill the promise
        promise(.success("Hello, world!"))
    }
}
```

This creates a publisher that performs an asynchronous task and emits a single value (`"Hello, world!"`) when the task completes. If the task encounters an error, the publisher emits an error instead.

- PassthroughSubject

```swift
class MyViewModel {
    private let usernameSubject = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

    var usernamePublisher: AnyPublisher<String, Never> {
        return usernameSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }

    func updateUsername(_ username: String) {
        usernameSubject.send(username)
    }
}
```

This creates a custom publisher (`usernameSubject`) that emits a string value whenever the `updateUsername` method is called. The publisher is erased to an `AnyPublisher` so that it can be safely exposed to the public interface of the view model.

- CurrentValueSubject

```swift
// Define a CurrentValueSubject with an initial value of 0
let subject = CurrentValueSubject<Int, Never>(0)

// Subscribe to the subject and print out each emitted value
let cancellable = subject.sink { value in
    print("Value: \(value)")
}

// Update the value of the subject
subject.send(1)
subject.send(2)

// Print out the current value of the subject
print("Current value: \(subject.value)")

// Cancel the subscription
cancellable.cancel()
/* output:
Value: 0
Value: 1
Value: 2
Current value: 2
*/
```

- When to use Just, Future, PassthroughSubject , CurrentValueSubject:
   - You can use a Just publisher to start a chain of publishers.
   - `Just`: Use `Just` when you want to create a publisher that emits a single value and then completes. This is useful when you want to create a publisher that emits a constant value or a value that can be calculated at the time of subscription. A Just publisher is also useful when replacing a value with `Publishers.Catch`, And Just always produces a value without error.
   - `Future`: Use `Future` when you want to create a publisher that emits a single value at some point in the future. This is useful when you want to perform some asynchronous work, such as network requests or disk I/O, and then emit a value when the work is complete.
   - `PassthroughSubject`: Use `PassthroughSubject` when you want to create a publisher that allows you to manually send values to its subscribers. This is useful when you want to create a custom publisher that emits values based on some external events or user interactions.
   - `CurrentValueSubject`: Use `CurrentValueSubject` when you want to create a publisher that wraps a single value and publishes it to its subscribers when the value changes. This is useful when you want to create a publisher that represents a mutable state, such as the state of a user interface element or a shared data model.

   In general, you should choose the type of publisher that best fits your specific use case. For example, if you need to perform some asynchronous work and then emit a value, you would use `Future`. If you need to create a custom publisher that emits values based on user interactions, you would use `PassthroughSubject`. If you need to represent a mutable state that can be updated by multiple parts of your application, you would use `CurrentValueSubject`.

3. Creating a Subscriber

There are two types of subscribers in Combine:

- The `sink` subscriber, which allows you to define closures to handle emitted values, errors, and completion notifications.
- The `assign` subscriber, which allows you to assign emitted values to a property on an object.
- You can also create a custom subscriber by implementing the `Subscriber` protocol.

Let's look at some examples:

- sink

```swift
let publisher = Just("Hello, world!")

publisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print("Received completion: \($0)") },
          receiveValue: { print("Received value: \($0)") })
```

This creates a subscriber using the `sink` method, which prints any value emitted by the publisher (`"Hello, world!"`) and also prints any completion events (in this case, a completion with no error).

- assign

```swift
class MyViewModel {
    let username = CurrentValueSubject<String, Never>("")
    
    var usernameLabelText: String {
        didSet {
			print(usernameLabelText)
        }
    }
    
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    
    init() {
        username
            .assign(to: \.usernameLabelText, on: self)
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }

	deinit {
        cancellables.forEach { $0.cancel() }
    }
}
```

This creates a subscriber using the `assign` method, which assigns the value emitted by the publisher (`username`) to a property on the subscriber (`usernameLabelText`). In this example, the subscriber is a view model, and the property being assigned to (`usernameLabelText`) is a string that is displayed in the user interface. The subscriber is also added to a set of `cancellables` to ensure that it is deallocated when the view model is no longer needed.

4. Connecting Publishers and Subscribers
   - Use the `subscribe` method to connect a publisher to a subscriber.
   - Use the `eraseToAnyPublisher` method to type-erase a publisher.

Here are some examples:

- Using `subscribe` with a custom subscriber:

```swift
let publisher = Just("Hello, world!")

class MySubscriber: Subscriber {
    typealias Input = String
    typealias Failure = Never
    
    func receive(subscription: Subscription) {
        subscription.request(.max(1))
    }
    
    func receive(_ input: String) -> Subscribers.Demand {
        print("Received value: \(input)")
        return .none
    }
    
    func receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Never>) {
        print("Received completion: \(completion)")
    }
}

publisher.subscribe(MySubscriber())
```

This connects a publisher (`publisher`) to a subscriber using the `subscribe` method with a custom subscriber. In this example, the subscriber is a custom class (`MySubscriber`) that implements the `Subscriber` protocol. The subscriber receives a string value from the publisher and prints it to the console. The subscriber also implements the `receiveCompletion` method to print any completion events emitted by the publisher.

- Type-erasing a publisher with a known output and failure type:

```swift
let publisher = Just("Hello, world!")
let anyPublisher = publisher.eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

This creates a publisher(`publisher`) that emits a string value and then type-erases it to an `AnyPublisher<String, Never>` using the `eraseToAnyPublisher` method.

- Type-erasing a publisher for use in a public API:

```swift
class MyViewModel {
    private let usernameSubject = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
    
    var usernamePublisher: AnyPublisher<String, Never> {
        return usernameSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
    
    func updateUsername(_ username: String) {
        usernameSubject.send(username)
    }
}
```

This creates a custom publisher (`usernameSubject`) that emits a string value whenever the `updateUsername` method is called. The publisher is type-erased to an `AnyPublisher` using the `eraseToAnyPublisher` method so that it can be safely exposed to the public interface of the view model. This allows clients of the view model to subscribe to the publisher without needing to know the specific type of publisher being used.

By understanding how to work with publishers and subscribers in Swift Combine, you can create powerful data flows that handle asynchronous and event-driven programming tasks with ease. In the next section, we'll cover how to use operators to transform and manipulate data streams in Combine.
