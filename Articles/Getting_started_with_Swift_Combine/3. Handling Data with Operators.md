In this section, we'll learn how to use different types of operators to handle data that is emitted from publishers, these are the most powerful tools in Swift Combine, but they can be a little hard to learn. So sit tight, and let's roll.

Operators are an essential tool for working with data streams in Swift Combine. Operators are methods that transform, filter, and combine data streams, they return new publishers, allowing you to chain them together to create complex data transformations, this process is also called republishing.

We introduce these operators in four types:

- Filtering and transforming data
- Combining multiple streams of data
- Controlling Timing
- Error handling and debugging

# A. Filtering and transforming data

In this section, we'll show you how to use these operators to filter and transform a data stream and chain some of them in a real-world application:

- filter
- map
- reduce
- flatMap
- scan
- encode
- decode

## filter

The `filter` operator in Swift Combine is used to selectively emit values from a publisher based on a provided condition. The `filter` operator takes a closure that returns a Boolean value and applies it to each value emitted by the publisher. Only values for which the closure returns `true` are forwarded downstream to the subscriber.

Here's an example of using the `filter` operator to emit only even integers from a `PassthroughSubject` publisher:

```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let subscription = subject
    .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 } // Only emit even integers
    .sink { print($0) }

subject.send(1) // Won't be emitted because it's odd
subject.send(2) // Will be emitted because it's even
subject.send(3) // Won't be emitted because it's odd
subject.send(4) // Will be emitted because it's even

// Output: 2 4
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits integers. We use the `filter` operator to only emit even integers downstream to the subscriber. When we send integers to the publisher, only even integers are printed by the subscriber.

## map

The `map` operator in Swift Combine is used to transform values emitted by a publisher. The `map` operator takes a closure that transforms each value emitted by the publisher and emits the transformed value downstream to the subscriber.

Here's an example of using the `map` operator to transform a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits integers into a publisher that emits the squared values of those integers:

```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let subscription = subject
    .map { $0 * $0 } // Square each emitted integer
    .sink { print($0) }

subject.send(1)
subject.send(2)
subject.send(3)

// Output: 1 4 9
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits integers. We use the `map` operator to transform each emitted integer into its squared value downstream to the subscriber. When we send integers to the publisher, the subscriber prints the squared values of those integers.

## reduce

The `reduce` operator in Swift Combine is used to accumulate values emitted by a publisher into a single value. It takes an initial value and a closure that combines the previous accumulated value with the current value emitted by the publisher. The result of the closure is emitted downstream to the subscriber, and becomes the new accumulated value for the next emission.

The `reduce` operator requires the publisher to complete before emitting the final accumulated value. This means that the subscriber will only receive the final result once the publisher has finished emitting values.

Here's an example of using the `reduce` operator to accumulate the sum of all integers emitted by a `PassthroughSubject` publisher:

```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let subscription = subject
    .reduce(0, +) // Accumulate the sum of all emitted integers
    .sink { print($0) }

subject.send(1)
subject.send(2)
subject.send(3)
subject.send(completion: .finished)

// Output: 6
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits integers. We use the `reduce` operator to accumulate the sum of all emitted integers downstream to the subscriber. When we send integers to the publisher, the subscriber prints the accumulated sum of those integers after the publisher has finished emitting values.

The `reduce` operator is useful for accumulating values emitted by a publisher into a single value, but it requires the publisher to complete before emitting the final result. It can be combined with other operators to create more complex processing pipelines for reactive programming in Swift.

## flatMap

The `flatMap` operator in Swift Combine is used to transform values emitted by a publisher into new publishers, and then flatten those publishers into a single stream of values.

The `flatMap` operator takes a closure that returns a publisher for each value emitted by the original publisher. The operator subscribes to each inner publisher and forwards their values downstream to the subscriber. The inner publishers are flattened into a single stream of values, which are emitted in the order they are received.

Here's an example of using the `flatMap` operator to flatten a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits arrays of integers:

```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<[Int], Never>()

let subscription = subject
    .flatMap { array in
        return array.map({ $0 + 1 }).publisher // Transform each element and convert to a publisher
    }
    .sink { print($0) }

subject.send([1, 2, 3])
subject.send([4, 5, 6])

// Output: 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits arrays of integers. We use the `flatMap` operator to transform each integer in the emitted arrays by adding 1 to it. We then convert each transformed integer into a publisher using the `publisher` property and flatten the resulting publishers into a single stream of values. When we send arrays of integers to the publisher, the subscriber prints the flattened stream of integers in the order they are received.

The `flatMap` operator is useful for transforming values emitted by a publisher into new publishers and flattening them into a single stream of values. It can be combined with other operators to create more complex processing pipelines for reactive programming in Swift.

## scan

The `scan` operator in Swift Combine is used to accumulate values emitted by a publisher into a sequence of intermediate results. It is similar to the `reduce` operator, but instead of emitting the final accumulated value, it emits each intermediate result as it is calculated.

The `scan` operator takes an initial value and a closure that combines the previous accumulated value with the current value emitted by the publisher. The result of the closure is emitted downstream to the subscriber as an intermediate result, and becomes the new accumulated value for the next emission.

Here's an example of using the `scan` operator to accumulate the running sum of integers emitted by a `PassthroughSubject` publisher:

```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let subscription = subject
    .scan(0, +) // Accumulate the running sum of all emitted integers
    .sink { print($0) }

subject.send(1)
subject.send(2)
subject.send(3)

// Output: 1 3 6
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher that emits integers. We use the `scan` operator to accumulate the running sum of all emitted integers downstream to the subscriber. When we send integers to the publisher, the subscriber prints the intermediate result of the running sum after each value has been emitted.

The `scan` operator is useful for accumulating values emitted by a publisher into a sequence of intermediate results. It can be combined with other operators to create more complex processing pipelines for reactive programming in Swift.

## encode

In Swift Combine, the `encode` operator is used to encode a value emitted by a publisher to a specified format, such as JSON or XML.

The `encode` operator takes an instance of an encoder that conforms to the `TopLevelEncoder` protocol and returns a publisher that encodes the values emitted by the upstream publisher, which need to conform to `Encodable`, using the provided encoder.

Here's an example of using the `encode` operator to encode a custom struct as JSON:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let person = Person(name: "John", age: 30)

let publisher = Just(person)
    .encode(encoder: JSONEncoder()) // Encode the person as JSON
    .map { String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) } // Convert the Data object to a String
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print($0) }, receiveValue: { print($0 ?? "") })

// Output: {"name":"John","age":30}
```

In this example, we use the `Just` publisher to emit a custom `Person` struct. We then use the `encode` operator to encode the `Person` struct as JSON Data using the `JSONEncoder`. To convert the resulting `Data` object to a `String`, we use the `map` operator to apply the `String(data:encoding:)` initializer to each emitted `Data` object. Finally, the resulting `String` is emitted downstream to the subscriber, which prints the encoded JSON string.

The `encode` operator is useful for encoding values emitted by a publisher to a specified format for further processing or communication. It can be combined with other operators to create more complex processing pipelines for reactive programming in Swift.

## decode

In Swift Combine, the `decode` operator is used to decode a stream of data in a specified format (such as JSON or XML) emitted by a publisher into an instance of a Swift type that conforms to the `Decodable` protocol.

The `decode` operator takes an instance of a decoder that conforms to the `TopLevelDecoder` protocol and returns a publisher that decodes the values emitted by the upstream publisher using the provided decoder.

Here's an example of using the `decode` operator to decode a stream of JSON data into an instance of a custom `Person` struct:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let jsonData = """
    {"name": "John", "age": 30}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

let publisher = Just(jsonData)
    .decode(type: Person.self, decoder: JSONDecoder()) // Decode the JSON data to a Person struct
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print($0) }, receiveValue: { print($0) })

// Output: Person(name: "John", age: 30)
```

n this example, we create a `Just` publisher that emits a stream of JSON data. We then use the `decode` operator to decode the JSON data into an instance of the custom `Person` struct using the `JSONDecoder`. The resulting `Person` object is emitted downstream to the subscriber, which prints the decoded value.

The `decode` operator is useful for decoding streams of data emitted by a publisher into instances of custom types for further processing or use in your application. It can be combined with other operators to create more complex processing pipelines for reactive programming in Swift.

## Operator Chaining

Operators can be chained together to create more complex data transformations, chaining operators creates a new publisher with each step of the transformation. Now, let's do some operator chaining.

- Chaining `map` and `filter`:

```swift
let publisher = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

publisher
    .map { value in
        return value * 2
    }
    .filter { value in
        return value % 3 == 0
    }
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

publisher.send(1)
publisher.send(2)
publisher.send(3)
publisher.send(4)
publisher.send(5)

// Output: Received value: 6
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits integer values and then chains the `map` and `filter` operators together. The `map` operator doubles the emitted values, and the `filter` operator only passes through values that are divisible by 3. The subscriber then receives the filtered and mapped values (`6`) and prints them to the console.

- Chaining `flatMap` and `filter`:

```swift
let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

publisher
    .flatMap { value in
        return Just(value.count)
    }
    .filter { count in
        return count % 2 == 0
    }
    .sink { count in
        print("Received value with even count: \(count)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

publisher.send("Hello")
publisher.send("World!")
publisher.send("Swift")

// Output: Received value with even count: 6
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits string values and then chains the `flatMap` and `filter` operators together. The `flatMap` operator transforms each string value into a new publisher that emits the count of the string. The `filter` operator then only passes through values that have an even count. The subscriber then receives the filtered and mapped values (`6`) and prints them to the console.

- Chaining `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

let result = numbers.publisher
    .map { $0 * 2 } // Multiply each number by 2
    .filter { $0 % 3 == 0 } // Filter out any numbers that aren't divisible by 3
    .reduce(0, +) // Sum all of the remaining numbers
    .sink { print($0) }

print(result) // Output: 36
```

In this example, we have an array of numbers from 1 to 10. We create a publisher from this array using the `publisher` property. We then chain three operators:

- `map`: We use the `map` operator to multiply each number by 2, so that we end up with an array of numbers from 2 to 20.
- `filter`: We use the `filter` operator to remove any numbers that aren't divisible by 3, so that we end up with an array of numbers 6, 12, and 18.
- `reduce`: Finally, we use the `reduce` operator to sum all of the remaining numbers, starting with an initial value of 0. The resulting value is 36.

# B. Combining multiple streams of data

In some cases, you may need to combine multiple data streams in your application. This could be useful for tasks like merging user input with data from a server or updating a UI component based on multiple sources of data. Swift Combine provides a variety of operators to help you combine multiple streams of data.

## zip

In Swift Combine, the `zip` operator is used to combine two publishers into a new publisher that emits tuples containing the latest values from each of the input publishers.

The returned publisher waits until both publishers have emitted an event, then delivers the oldest unconsumed event from each publisher together as a tuple to the subscriber. If either upstream publisher finishes successfully or fails with an error, so too does the zipped publisher.

Here's an example of using the `zip` operator to combine two publishers that receive values from user input:

```swift
let username = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
let password = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

let credentials = Publishers.Zip(username, password)
    .map { (username: $0, password: $1) }

let cancellable = credentials
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print($0) },
          receiveValue: { print("Username: \($0.username), Password: \($0.password)") })

username.send("john.doe@example.com")
password.send("password123")
password.send("password456")
username.send("mike.gould@example.com")
username.send(completion: .finished)
/*
  Output:
  Username: john.doe@example.com, Password: password123
  Username: mike.gould@example.com, Password: password456
  finished
*/
```

In this example, we create two `PassthroughSubject` publishers, `username` and `password`, that receive values from user input. We use the `Zip` operator to combine these two publishers into a new publisher called `credentials`, which emits tuples containing the latest values from each of the input publishers. We then use the `map` operator to convert the tuples into a more meaningful type for our use case.

Finally, we use the `sink` operator to subscribe to the `credentials` publisher and print out the latest values emitted by it. We then send two pairs of values to the `username` and `password` publishers, respectively, and observe the output of the `sink` operator.

The output of this example is two tuples of the username and password values that were sent to the `username` and `password` publishers, respectively. Then `username` send finished event that cause the zipped publisher finished.

Similarly, you can use `Publishers.Zip3` and `Publishers.Zip4` to zip three or four publishers(There is no Zip5).

## merge

In Swift Combine, the `merge` operator is used to combine multiple publishers into a single publisher that emits values from all of the input publishers in a non-deterministic order.

The `merge` operator takes a variable number of input publishers and returns a new publisher that emits values from all of the input publishers as they are received. Each time one of the input publishers emits a new value, the `merge` operator emits that value downstream.

Here's an example of using the `merge` method on two `PassthroughSubject` publishers to merge them together and emit their values:

```swift
let publisher1 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let publisher2 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let mergedPublisher = publisher1
    .merge(with: publisher2)
    .sink { print($0) }

publisher1.send(1)
publisher2.send(2)
publisher1.send(3)
publisher2.send(4)

// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
```

In this example, we create two `PassthroughSubject` publishers, `publisher1` and `publisher2`, that emit integer values. We use the `merge` method to merge these two publishers into a new publisher called `mergedPublisher`, which emits values from both publishers as they are received. We then use the `sink` operator to subscribe to `mergedPublisher` and print out the latest values emitted by it.

Finally, we send four integer values to `publisher1` and `publisher2`, respectively, and observe the output of the `sink` operator. As expected, the output includes all four integer values in the order they were sent.

You can merge as many publishers as you wish. The `merge` operator  can be useful in situations where you have multiple publishers that emit related data streams that need to be processed together.

## combineLatest

The `combineLatest` operator in Swift Combine is used to combine the latest values from multiple publishers into a new publisher. Whenever any of the input publishers emit a new value, the `combineLatest` operator combines the latest value from each publisher and emits the combined result as a tuple downstream.

Here's an example of using the `combineLatest` operator to combine two publishers that emit integer values:

```swift
let numbers1 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let numbers2 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

let combinedPublisher = numbers1
    .combineLatest(numbers2)
    .sink { print("Numbers: \($0)") }

numbers1.send(1)
numbers2.send(2)
numbers1.send(3)
numbers2.send(4)

// Output: Numbers: (1, 2), Numbers: (3, 2), Numbers: (3, 4)
```

In this example, we create two `PassthroughSubject` publishers, `numbers1` and `numbers2`, that emit integer values. We use the `combineLatest` operator to combine the latest value from each publisher and emit the combined result downstream. We then use the `sink` operator to subscribe to the `combinedPublisher` and print out the latest combined values emitted by it.

Finally, we send four integer values to `numbers1` and `numbers2`, respectively, and observe the output of the `sink` operator. As expected, the output includes the latest combined values from `numbers1` and `numbers2` each time either publisher emits a new value.

The `combineLatest` operator can be useful in situations where you need to combine the latest values from multiple publishers and process them together. For example, it can be used to update a user interface whenever any of the input data sources change.

# C. Controlling Timing

## measureInterval

This operator measures the time interval between each emission of a publisher and emits the interval as a `TimeInterval` value. It is useful for timing-related tasks, such as measuring the frame rate of a game or animation.

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let publisher = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .default).autoconnect()

publisher
    .measureInterval(using: DispatchQueue.global())
    .sink { interval in
        print("Received interval: \(interval)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

This creates a timer publisher (`publisher`) that emits a value every second and then uses the `measureInterval` operator to measure the time interval between each emission. The subscriber receives the time interval between each emission and prints it to the console.

## debounce

This operator delays the emission of values from a publisher until a specified time has elapsed without any further values being emitted. This is useful for filtering out noise or duplicate values, or for handling user input that can generate multiple events in a short time.

```swift
let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

publisher
    .debounce(for: .seconds(1), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

publisher.send("H")
publisher.send("He")
publisher.send("Hel")
publisher.send("Hell")
publisher.send("Hello")
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1000_000_000)
publisher.send("World")
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1000_000_000)
publisher.send(completion: .finished)
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1000_000_000)
/*
  output:
  Received value: Hello
  Received value: World
*/
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits string values and then uses the `debounce` operator to only pass through values that have not been followed by another value within one second. The subscriber then receives the debounced values (`Hello` and `World`) and prints them to the console.

## delay

This operator delays the emission of values from a publisher by a specified time interval. This is useful for simulating network latency or other time-based effects.

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let publisher = Just("Hello, world!")

publisher
    .delay(for: .seconds(2), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits a single string value (`Hello, world!`) and then uses the `delay` operator to delay the emission of the value by two seconds. The subscriber then receives the delayed value (`Hello, world!`) and prints it to the console.

## throttle

This operator limits the rate at which values are emitted by a publisher by only emitting the latest value that has been emitted within a specified time interval. This is useful for handling user input or other fast-changing data streams.

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

publisher
    .throttle(for: .seconds(1), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main, latest: true)
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

publisher.send("H")
publisher.send("He")
publisher.send("Hel")
publisher.send("Hell")
publisher.send("Hello")
publisher.send("World")
publisher.send(completion: .finished)
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits string values and then uses the `throttle` operator to only pass through values that have not been followed by another value within one second. The `latest` parameter is set to `true`, which means that the latest value emitted within the time window will be passed through to the subscriber. The subscriber then receives the throttled value (`World`) and prints it to the console. If you change latest to false, it'll receives the value `H`.

## timeout

This operator sets a time limit on the emission of values from a publisher and generates an error if the time limit is exceeded. This is useful for handling network requests or other time-sensitive tasks where a response is expected within a certain time frame.

```swift
enum TimeoutError: Error {
    case timeout
}

var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, TimeoutError>()

publisher
    .timeout(.seconds(2), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main, customError: { () -> TimeoutError in
        return TimeoutError.timeout
    })
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .finished:
                print("Finished")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error: \(error)")
            }
        },
        receiveValue: { value in
            print("Received value: \(value)")
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)

publisher.send("Hello")
publisher.send("World")
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) {
    publisher.send("Timeout")
}
```

This creates a publisher (`publisher`) that emits string values and then uses the `timeout` operator to set a time limit of 2 seconds for the emission of each value. If a value is not emitted within the time limit, the publisher sends a custom error of `TimeoutError` type to the subscriber. The subscriber receives the timed-out values and error, and prints them to the console.

When executed, this code will output the following to the console:

```swift
Received value: Hello
Received value: World
Error: timeout
```

# D. Error handling and debugging

When working with reactive programming and asynchronous data streams, it's important to handle errors and debug your code effectively. Swift Combine provides a variety of tools for error handling and debugging. Here are some techniques you can use:

## catch

- The `catch` operator allows you to handle errors emitted by a publisher.
- When an error is emitted, the `catch` operator can either replace the error with a new value or emit a new error.
- Use this operator to handle errors and recover from them.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `catch` operator to handle errors:

```swift
enum MyError: Error {
    case invalidValue
}

let numbers: [Any] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "Six", 7, 8, 9, 10]
let publisher = numbers.publisher
let filteredPublisher = publisher.tryMap { value -> Int in  
	guard let intValue = value as? Int else {  
		throw MyError.invalidValue  
	}  
	return intValue
}.catch { error in  
	return Just(0)
}

filteredPublisher.sink { print($0) }
```

In this example, we create a publisher that emits both integers and a string value. We then use the `tryMap` operator to convert each value to an integer, throwing an error if the value is not an integer, and terminate publishing when the map’s closure throws an error. We use the `catch` operator to replace any errors with a default value of 0. When we subscribe to the `filteredPublisher` using the `sink` method, we print out each value that it emits, including the replaced values, it ended up at the error emit:

```swift
1
2
3
4
5
0
```

The `catch` operator can be useful for gracefully handling errors within a publisher chain and recovering from them by returning a new publisher.

## print

- The `print` operator allows you to print debug information about a publisher.
- You can print information about each value emitted by the publisher, as well as any errors that occur.
- Use this operator to understand what's happening inside your data streams.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `print` operator to print debug information:

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let publisher = numbers.publisher
publisher
    .print("Numbers")
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

In this example, we use the `print` operator to print debug information about the `publisher` before it emits values. When we subscribe to the publisher using the `sink` method, we print out each value that it emits. The output of this code looks like this:

```swift
Numbers: receive subscription: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Numbers: request unlimited
Numbers: receive value: (1)
Received value: 1
Numbers: receive value: (2)
Received value: 2
Numbers: receive value: (3)
Received value: 3
Numbers: receive value: (4)
Received value: 4
Numbers: receive value: (5)
Received value: 5
Numbers: receive finished
```

The `print` operator adds debugging information to our data stream, showing us when it's subscribed, when it requests values, and when it finished.

## breakpoint

- The `breakpoint` operator allows you to pause your code in Xcode's debugger when a value is emitted by a publisher.
- This can be useful for debugging complex data flows and understanding how your code is working.
- Use this operator to identify and fix problems in your Combine code.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `breakpoint` operator to pause our code in Xcode's debugger:

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let publisher = numbers.publisher

publisher
    .breakpoint(receiveOutput: { value in
        return value > 3
    })
    .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

In this example, we use the `breakpoint` operator to pause our code in Xcode's debugger when a value greater than 3 is emitted by the `publisher`. When we run this code in Xcode, the debugger will pause on the line with the `breakpoint` operator when it encounters a value greater than 3, allowing us to inspect the state of our data stream and identify any issues.

The `breakpoint` operator is a powerful debugging tool that allows us to pause our code and inspect our data streams in real time, helping us identify and fix problems quickly and efficiently.

## breakpointOnError

The `breakpointOnError` operator in Swift Combine is a debugging tool that allows you to pause the publisher stream and examine the error that caused the stream to terminate. This can be useful when debugging complex publisher chains to help pinpoint where errors are occurring and what might be causing them.

Here's an example of using the `breakpointOnError` operator in a publisher chain:

```swift
enum ExampleError: Error {
    case example
}

var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].publisher

numbers
    .map { $0 * 2 }
    .filter { $0 % 3 == 0 }
    .tryMap { value -> Int in
        if value == 6 {
            throw ExampleError.example
        }
        return value
    }
    .breakpointOnError()
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .finished:
                print("Finished")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error: \(error)")
            }
        },
        receiveValue: { value in
            print(value)
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

In this example, we create a `Publisher` that emits a sequence of integers from an array. We then chain several operators together, including `map`, `filter`, and `tryMap`, to transform and filter the emitted values.

We insert the `breakpointOnError` operator after the `tryMap` operator. If an error occurs during the execution of the publisher chain, the stream will pause and wait for you to debug the error before continuing.

In this example, we deliberately throw an error when the value 6 is encountered. When the `tryMap` operator encounters this error, the `breakpointOnError` operator will pause the stream, allowing you to examine the error and the current state of the publisher chain. Once you have finished debugging, you can resume the stream by pressing the continue button in your debugger.

The `breakpointOnError` operator can be useful when debugging complex publisher chains, especially when errors are difficult to trace back to their source.

## handleEvents

The `handleEvents` operator in Swift Combine allows you to attach closures to a publisher at different points in its lifecycle, such as before and after events like subscription and completion. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring a publisher's behavior, as well as for performing additional side effects during the publisher chain.

Here's an example of using the `handleEvents` operator in a publisher chain:

```swift
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].publisher

numbers
    .handleEvents(
        receiveSubscription: { subscription in
            print("Received subscription: \(subscription)")
        },
        receiveOutput: { value in
            print("Received value: \(value)")
        },
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .finished:
                print("Finished")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error: \(error)")
            }
        },
        receiveCancel: {
            print("Cancelled")
        },
        receiveRequest: { demand in
            print("Received demand: \(demand)")
        }
    )
    .map { $0 * 2 }
    .sink { print($0) }
```

In this example, we create a `Publisher` that emits a sequence of integers from an array. We then attach the `handleEvents` operator to the publisher to perform various side effects during the publisher chain. We use the different closure parameters of the `handleEvents` operator to print out information about the subscription, output, completion, cancellation, and demand events of the publisher.

We then chain a `map` operator to double the emitted values and finally use the `sink` operator to print out the final values.

By using the `handleEvents` operator, we can monitor and debug the behavior of the publisher at different points in its lifecycle. For example, we can print out the demand requests made by downstream subscribers or detect when a subscription has been cancelled. We can also perform additional side effects during the publisher chain, such as logging or updating user interface elements.

In the next section, we'll explore the differences between Swift Combine and traditional programming models, and see how Swift Combine improves our programming flow.
